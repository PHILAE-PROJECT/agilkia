E-Shop: A Demo Shopping Application
===================================

This folder contains scripts for analysing traces from a dummy shop
that sells classic IT items, such as the original iPhone.

Here is the e-shop link: http://eshopdemo.smartesting.com

It is based on the open-source OpenCart software from https://www.opencart.com.
Anyone can play with the application in order to generate some traces.
You can get the history of all Log traces generated by the demo by downloading this file::

    http://eshopdemo.smartesting.com/system/storage/logs/OpenCartAction.txt 

The Log traces file is updated in real time as user traces as generated.
